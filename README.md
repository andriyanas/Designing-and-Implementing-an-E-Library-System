Designing and Implementing an E-Library System

1. Project's Objectives
The primary goal of the e-library application is to manage multiple libraries, each housing a diverse collection of books available for borrowing. The system enables users to borrow books, place holds on unavailable books, and manage their accounts. Key functionalities include user registration, book categorization, loan management, and a hold system to ensure a seamless borrowing experience.

2. Designing The Database
Creating a relational database for the e-library system involves several crucial steps:
  a.	Mission Statement
      To design a robust and scalable e-library application that efficiently manages multiple libraries, tracks book availability, and provides a seamless user experience for borrowing and placing holds on books.
  b.	ERD Design
      The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the relationships between various entities in the e-library system. The primary entities include:
      •	Users: Information about registered users.
      •	Libraries: Details of each library.
      •	Books: Information on book titles, authors, categories, and quantities.
      •	Loans: Records of books borrowed by users.
      •	Holds: Records of books placed on hold by users.

3. Implementing The Design
   Implementing the ERD in PostgreSQL involves translating the ERD into SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) statements. The tables and relationships defined in the ERD are created in the PostgreSQL database using these DDL statements.

4. Populating the Database
   The dummy dataset for each table is generated using Python and the Faker library. This dataset adheres to the rules and relational logic of the database.
 
5. Retrieve Data
   To retrieve meaningful insights from the database, several questions are posed, and SQL queries are executed to answer them. For example:
    a.	What is the average loan duration for books? How many books are currently on loan?
    b.	What are the most borrowed books?
    c.	Which users have borrowed the most books? How many books are currently on loan?
    d.	Which libraries have the highest number of books on hold?
    e.	What are the most common categories of borrowed books?
